## What is this?
It's a dashboard. These technologies and libraries where used to create it:

- React/Next.js
- Shadcn
- TypeScript
- Recharts
- React-Hook-Form
- Zod

This was originally created by following along a Traversy Media YouTube [course](https://youtu.be/hhudoSMM0yU?si=6Wn5glg-ElWjpUTC).

## 😎 improvements I made
- 🌞🌛 theme change on click 
    - used to show a drawer the user had to choose the theme from. now it just toggles the theme.
- 🔐 check password confirm
    - in `/auth` regiter form, check if password confirm matches the password
